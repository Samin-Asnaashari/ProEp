# 4.0.0 Uprising

- **[Braking change!]** options object reference is now live, so can be changed on the fly with instant effect, this feature can be disabled by 'options.copyOptions = true' flag so dragular then make copy of options object. It also means than provided options object will be extended with default value where option property is undefined.
- **[Braking change!]** flag 'options.ignoreInputTextSelection' default value is 'true'! Meaning that selecting text in input elements is not considered as drag, now by default!

- options.containersModel can be function returning model
- new directive attribute dragular-name-space for better readability of views
- new options flag `options.dynamicModelAttribute`, if true dragular will react on model changes
